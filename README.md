# PSclippy

I had this idea from a conversation with a colleague to automate giving him random abuse. I thought it would be hilarious if the old MS Clippy would be the messenger for the abuse. Credit to Stephen @ https://github.com/1RedOne for most of the work on this. I just adapted the concept to loop messages, his code has far more pratical application :)
